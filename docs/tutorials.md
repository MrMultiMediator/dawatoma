## Installation
To install, run `pip install dawatoma` in your terminal.

## Create your first derived melody
dawatoma comes pre-packaged with a note sequence you can work on in the
`assets` subfolder called `99.dawa`. You can use this melody to derive your own melodies,
write them to .midi, and also write them to .dawa. Make sure `99.dawa` is in your working
directory. Open up a python console.
